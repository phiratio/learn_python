This is a program which generates the Mandelbrot fractal set of a given width and height
for a given number of iterations.

It uses Pillow, the Python Imaging Library fork to render the image and save it to a file.

Sample Usage.


To see all command line arguments, pass -h to the program.

$ mandelbrot -h
usage: mandelbrot [-h] [-W WIDTH] [-H HEIGHT] [-n NITER] [-o OUTPUT]

Mandelbrot fractal generator

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -W WIDTH, --width WIDTH
                        Width of the image
  -H HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT
                        Height of the image
  -n NITER, --niter NITER
                        Number of iterations
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Name of output image file

By default, the program generates a mandelbrot fractal image of size 640x480 pixels to a file named mandelbrot.png for 1000 iterations to a file named mandelbrot.png .


$ mandelbrot
Creating mandelbrot set with size 640x480, #iterations=1000

Here is an example of creating an image of size 1280x720 pixels with 5000 iterations and saving it to
mandelbrot_big.png 

$ mandelbrot -W 1280 -H 720 -n 5000 -o mandelbrot_big.png

The package also includes the 'mandelbrot_mp' program which uses PyMP to improve performance by
parallel execution on multiple cores in the machine if available. The command line arguments remain the same.
