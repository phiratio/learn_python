Depending on which version of Kubernetes you have installed, you'll need to decide how you'll create objects. Here's a cheat sheet for how old commands should be used with the 1.18 changes.

kubectl run nginx --image nginx created a Deployment named nginx before 1.18 (which creates a ReplicaSet, which creates a Pod)

kubectl run nginx --image nginx creates a Pod named nginx in 1.18+

Creating a Deployment in 1.18: kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx


kk create deployment my-apache --image httpd
kk get all (to get deployment name)
kk scale deployment.apps/my-apache -- replicas 2
